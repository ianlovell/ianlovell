I’m an experienced software engineer focused on building **scalable, accessible, and maintainable frontends** using React, TypeScript, and Node.  

My passion lies in helping teams **achieve agility through technical excellence, communication, and collaboration**.

- **Backend & APIs** – Node.js, GraphQL, REST, and serverless cloud integration  
- **Developer experience** – tooling, documentation, and CI pipelines that scale  
- **Agile delivery** – Scrum, Kanban, XP, and flow-based continuous improvement
